   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS ON CONTINUOUS", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=SURFACE 1
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Construction INTERIOR WALL 2 of interzone surface SURFACE 54 does not have the same materials in the reverse order as the construction INTERIOR WALL of adjacent surface SURFACE 81
   **   ~~~   ** ...but Nominal U values are similar, diff=[0.0000] ... simulation proceeds.
   **   ~~~   ** ...if the two zones are expected to have significantly different temperatures, the proper "reverse" construction should be created.
   **   ~~~   ** ...this problem for this pair will not be reported again.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Construction INTERIOR CEILING 2 of interzone surface SURFACE 36 does not have the same materials in the reverse order as the construction INTERIOR FLOOR of adjacent surface SURFACE 78
   **   ~~~   ** ...but Nominal U values are similar, diff=[0.0000] ... simulation proceeds.
   **   ~~~   ** ...this problem for this pair will not be reported again.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Construction INTERIOR CEILING of interzone surface SURFACE 84 does not have the same materials in the reverse order as the construction INTERIOR FLOOR 2 of adjacent surface SURFACE 126
   **   ~~~   ** ...but Nominal U values are similar, diff=[0.0000] ... simulation proceeds.
   **   ~~~   ** ...this problem for this pair will not be reported again.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 36 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
